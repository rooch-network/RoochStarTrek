## Bootcamp Introduction

In the rapidly evolving blockchain industry, Bitcoin, as the first-generation cryptocurrency, still holds significant status undoubtedly. As the first successful implementation of a decentralized digital currency blockchain, Bitcoin has laid the foundation for the entire industry. However, over time, the Bitcoin network has faced challenges related to performance and scalability, creating opportunities for the emergence of Rooch.

The Rooch Network is a native application layer for Bitcoin, built on a stacked Layer 2 solution. It provides a launch platform for Bitcoin assets and infrastructure for Bitcoin applications, bringing new possibilities to Bitcoin. By leveraging the Move programming language, the Rooch Network constructs a programmable blockchain platform on the foundation of Bitcoin. This not only enhances Bitcoin's performance and scalability but also opens up new opportunities for developers. On one hand, the Rooch Network inherits Bitcoin's security and decentralization features, while on the other hand, it introduces the efficiency and programmability of the Move language. This enables developers to quickly build various decentralized applications (covering finance, gaming, social interactions, and more) on Rooch and provides tight integration with the native Bitcoin network, allowing applications to seamlessly interoperate with Bitcoin and inject new vitality into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Whether you are an experienced Bitcoin enthusiast or a newbee interested in blockchain technology, the Rooch Network is an important project worth paying attention to and understanding. Rooch looks forward to exploring the exciting revolutions brought by the Web3 world with you!
