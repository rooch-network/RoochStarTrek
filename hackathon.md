## ColorEgg

1. Project description

Color Egg is a project based on the Ordinals protocol and Rooch chain on Bitcoin. Through the characteristics of the status on Bitcoin that can be read on the Rooch chain, users can mint the ColorEgg inscription on Bitcoin. Each account holding the ColorEgg inscription can open it on the Rooch chain to obtain Egg Coin. Coin is stored in each Egg. As the block height increases, the number of Coin stored will be more. The user can get the Coin after breaking open the ColorEgg, but the number of Coin cannot be greater than the Coin Pool. Some users cannot get it, and the capacity of the Coin Pool is that for every increase in block height, 100 Coin will be added.
